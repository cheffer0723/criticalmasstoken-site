Critical Mass (MASS)

Critical Mass (MASS) is a long-term on-chain experiment deployed on the Base network. It explores collective attention, voluntary coordination, and structural governance evolution over extended time horizons.

MASS is intentionally minimal. It does not promise financial return, does not provide yield, and does not embed governance mechanisms at launch. The project prioritizes structural clarity, transparency, and restraint over speed or speculation.

Founding Phase

Critical Mass currently operates under a Founding Stewardship Phase.

During this phase, the Founding Steward coordinates:

Infrastructure maintenance

Documentation updates

Liquidity decisions

Governance research and structural design

This phase exists to provide stability and reduce ambiguity during early development. It is not intended as permanent centralized control.

Governance Direction

MASS does not currently implement on-chain governance.

Future governance evolution, if pursued, will be:

Documented publicly

Introduced incrementally

Aligned with supply distribution realities

Evaluated cautiously

Decentralization is treated as a process, not a declaration.
